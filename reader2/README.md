## descqa.reader2

This directory contains the second-generation reader interface "reader2". This interface is still under active development and is not used (and should not be used) in the current framework.

An example of using reader2 can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/portal.nersc.gov/project/lsst/yymao/DESCQA%20reader2%20demo.ipynb?flush_cache=true)
