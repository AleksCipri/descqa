# Configuration for flashTest
# 
# The following variables can be set here:
#
#         pathToInfo: abs path to file containing "test.info" data
#                     default: "<pathToFlashTest>/test.info"
#
#       pathToOutdir: abs path to directory for all FlashTest output
#                     default: "<pathToFlashTest>/output" unless overridden
#                              by the '-o' command-line option
#
#  pathToMainArchive: hostname:abs path to directory on remote machine where
#                     gzipped tarfiles of each invocation's results are stored
#                     OR simply an abs path if results are stored locally
#                     default: None - no archiving will be done
#
#  pathToViewArchive: hostname:abs path to directory on remote machine where
#                     each invocation's results minus certain large files (like
#                     executables and checkpoint files) are stored for viewing
#                     by FlashTestView OR simply an abs path if results are
#                     stored locally
#                     default: None - no archiving will be done
#
# pathToLocalArchive: abs path to directory on local machine where selected
#                     files and directories from the main archive may be stored
#                     for frequent access
#                     default: None - a logfile error is raised if user attempts
#                     to access the local archive when none is specified
#
#          useModule: name of python module in flashTest/lib where unprefixed
#                     entryPoint, setupper, compiler, executer, and tester
#                     classes can be found
#
# The keywords "entryPoint", "setupper", "compiler", "executer", and "tester"
# can also be assigned values here where the value is written according to the
# pattern "module-name.class-name" or simply "class-name" if a value has been
# assigned to "useModule".
#
# All keywords should be assigned values according to the pattern:
#
#   keyword: value
#
# Each variable/value pair must be on its own line, but otherwise
# whitespace does not matter.
#
# Comments begin with a '#'
