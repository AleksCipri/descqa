The VIPERS Multi-Lambda Survey. II
Diving with massive galaxies in 22 square degrees since z = 1.5
they use (h70^-1 mpc)^3 for vol, h70^-2 Mo for stellar mass
 Bruzual & Charlot (2003),
   assuming a Chabrier (2003) initial mass function.
    exponentially declining star formation history, 9 possible decay rates between 0.1 and 30 Gyr.  See paper sec. 4.1 for dust
    prescription-three considered including Chabrier (2000)
