In order to add new catalogs to this validation framework you need to provide two new pieces of code.

1) Catalog Reader (for example, see UWReader.py):
  This piece of code reads your catalog file and stores it in a reader object that also keeps track
  of the catalog type. This reader object will be used by the GalaxyCatalog getters defined next.

2) Galaxy Catalog getter (see GalaxyCatalog.py and then class get_UW_data):
  This piece of code provides getters for your specific catalog. These should then be able to be accessed
  by the user from the get_quantities method of GalaxyCatalog.GalaxyCatalog.
